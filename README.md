# Stock Market Price Prediction

This repository implements a predictive model for stock market prices using historical data. The project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly suited for time-series data. The model is trained on data fetched from the Alpha Vantage API.

## Features
- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Leverages the Alpha Vantage API for fetching daily stock price data.
- **LSTM-Based Prediction**: Implements a multi-layer LSTM network to predict stock prices.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes plots comparing actual vs. predicted prices.
- **Configurable Workflow**: Customize parameters such as stock symbols, training epochs, and visual settings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-market-prediction.git
   cd stock-market-prediction
Install required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Obtain your free Alpha Vantage API key.
Open the project.ipynb file and update the configuration section with your API key and desired stock symbol:
python
Copy code
config = {
    "alpha_vantage": {
        "key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "symbol": "IBM",  # Replace with your desired stock symbol
        ...
    },
}
Run all cells in the notebook to:
Fetch stock data.
Train the LSTM model.
Visualize results.
Project Workflow
Data Collection:

Fetch daily adjusted closing prices from Alpha Vantage.
Visualize historical trends.
Data Preparation:

Normalize and structure data for LSTM input.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Train an LSTM network with configurable hyperparameters:
Number of LSTM layers.
Learning rate.
Epochs.
Prediction & Visualization:

Predict stock prices on test data.
Plot actual vs. predicted prices.
Results
The model successfully predicts stock price trends with reasonable accuracy. Below is a sample visualization of actual vs. predicted prices:
